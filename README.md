# Financial Analysis (PyBank)

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

In this work, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of PyBank. 
With a set of financial data called budget_data.csv, the dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

* Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
    - The total number of months included in the dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

   - The total number of votes cast
   - A complete list of candidates who received votes
   - The percentage of votes each candidate won
   - The total number of votes each candidate won
